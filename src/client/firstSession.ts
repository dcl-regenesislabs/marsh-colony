// Custom first session — the guided first visit that walks a brand-new player
// from adopting their first pet to hatching their first hybrid
// (dev-docs/first-session-tutorial.md, plan in
// dev-docs/first-session-implementation-plan.md).
//
// It is NOT a resumable tutorial: it only runs during the very first visit
// (the server sets PlayerSnapshot.firstSession), and the next visit is the
// normal game wherever this one stopped. Every hook this module adds to the
// game must go through firstSessionActive(), which is false for every
// returning player — so for them the game behaves exactly as before.
